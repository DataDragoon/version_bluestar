# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Project Overview

SFCW radar for within-wall imaging (rebar, pipes, voids, studs — not beyond the wall).
See CONTEXT.md for full system description.

## Key Facts

- This repo runs on TWO machines: Raspberry Pi (pi/) and PC (groundstation/)
- Clone the repo on both; run the appropriate code on each
- Pi never receives direct user input — all control via groundstation over LAN
- Heavy compute (SAR reconstruction, ML) belongs on the PC side
- Every subsystem must have a corresponding debug tool on groundstation

## Code Conventions

- Python for all Pi code (sensor drivers, radar control, networking)
- Python or TypeScript for groundstation (TBD based on UI framework choice)
- Shared protocol definitions in shared/protocols/
- Keep sensor interfaces minimal and async-friendly
- Prefer ZeroMQ or similar for IPC once protocol is chosen

## Hardware Context

- Raspberry Pi with AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L accelerator)
- LiDAR: TF-LC02 (UART, 115200 baud default)
- IMU: MPU-6500 (I2C, address 0x68)
- SDR: bladeRF (USB, use libbladeRF / pybladeRF)
- Antennas: 2x Vivaldi (wideband, one TX one RX)

## Living Documentation Rule

CLAUDE.md and CONTEXT.md are living documents. Whenever you learn key information
worth persisting — new design decisions, hardware findings, protocol choices,
calibration values, architectural changes, or anything a future session would
need to know — update CLAUDE.md and/or CONTEXT.md immediately. Don't wait to be
asked. These files are how context survives across sessions and collaborators.

## Current Phase

IMU, LiDAR, and bladeRF SDR integrated. All stream to groundstation debug panels.
RF Calib panel provides signal generator + oscilloscope for bladeRF calibration — always
runs both channels (antenna TX1/RX1 + reference TX2/RX2 loopback) simultaneously, viewport
split left (antenna) / right (reference) for both TX and RX.
SFCW panel performs stepped-frequency sweeps (2–5 GHz, hard-bounded by the quick-tune master
table's 256-profile hardware ceiling — see Quick-tune master table below) with range profile
+ waterfall display.
Both RF panels share port 9003 — starting an SFCW sweep auto-stops any active TX/RX in RF Calib.
C-scan panel rasters a 2D grid of positions over the target and shares the SFCW panel's
background model machinery (see below).

## SFCW Amplitude Scaling (Dynamic / Manual)

The SFCW panel carries an `sfcwScaleRange = { dynamic, min, max, isDb }` (App.jsx), the
same shape the C-scan panel uses for its colour scale. Dynamic (the default) is the old
behaviour: the range profile's Y axis tracks session-wide extremes and the waterfall's
colour range tracks its visible history. Manual pins **both** panes to one pair of limits.

Seeding matters: the live limits are computed inside `SfcwDisplay`, not the panel, so the
display publishes them every frame through `onDynamicScale` into an App-level **ref**
(`sfcwDynamicScale`) — a ref, not state, so a 3–6 Hz sweep does not re-render the sidebar.
The panel reads it via `getDynamicScale()` at the moment the toggle is clicked, so switching
to manual never makes the colours or the axis jump.

`isDb` records which units the pinned numbers are in. Flipping the display's dB/LIN button
(or "Reset Scale") hands the scale back to dynamic, because dB limits are meaningless on a
linear trace. Panes flag a pinned scale with an amber `MANUAL` next to their title, and the
waterfall's colour-bar numbers turn amber too.

The other two `SfcwDisplay` instances (C-scan and BG Model live sweep) pass no `scaleRange`
and stay dynamic — `manual` is false whenever the prop is absent.

## Background Subtraction — Groundstation Only (SFCW + B-scan)

All background subtraction happens on the groundstation. The Pi ships raw `h_cal`,
holds no background state, and has no notion of a B-scan at all. These commands no
longer exist: `sfcw_capture_bg`, `sfcw_clear_bg`, `sfcw_bg_mode`, `bscan_clear_bg`,
`bscan_capture`, `bscan_bg_capture`, `bgmodel_capture`. Every "capture" now works by
tagging the next `sfcw_result` to arrive, groundstation-side, with a ref flag.

Both panels offer the same two mutually exclusive sources:
- **Captured reference** — "Capture BG" tags the next sweep as `sfcwBgRef` / `bscanBgRef`.
- **ML model** — "Load Model" infers a background from lidar standoff (`bgModelInfer.js`).

Selecting either clears the other; "Clear BG" clears both. Subtraction is always complex
(vector) — the old complex/magnitude toggle is gone, complex was the default and is now
the only mode.

- SFCW live display: `App.jsx` `processedSfcwResult`.
- C-scan: `lib/bscanBg.js` `applyBscanBg()`, shared by `processedBscanData` (C-scan +
  2D Map), `sarProcessedData` (SAR), and `alignedSvdData` (Aligned).

**The model path is strictly better for B-scans.** A captured reference is only valid
near the standoff it was taken at, so B-scan positions are corrected by phase-aligning
it with the lidar standoff difference — a fudge that degrades as the hand-held standoff
drifts. A model is evaluated at *each position's own* standoff, so no alignment is
needed and it stays valid across the whole captured span. Outside that span the Akima
interpolator clamps, so the panel flags standoffs beyond the model's `d` range.

The Aligned panel subtracts first and rotates the residual to the common reference
position. That is identical to rotating both and subtracting (the alignment ramp is a
common factor) and it lets the model see each position's true standoff.

**Why groundstation-side:** Pi-side subtraction ran before transmission, so it silently
contaminated B-scan captures, SAR, and BG-model *training* data, which all read
`msg.h_cal_*`. Keeping the wire raw means only the live display is affected.

Note `SfcwDisplay` recomputes its own range profile from `h_cal_real/imag` for
windowing/range-comp, so any subtraction must write back into those fields — replacing
only `magnitudes`/`distances` gets silently discarded. `applyBscanBg` does this.

**Removed from the panel:** the SVD filter (the Aligned, SAR and 2D Map panels
keep their own; `lib/svd.js` stays) and the Wall section. Wall standoff / thickness /
permittivity were never doing refraction work in practice — εr defaulted to 1, so the
distance correction was the identity and the only live effect was capping display depth
at the wall thickness. That is now a single `maxDepth` field (cm, default 30) under
Display, used by both `BscanDisplay` and `sar.worker.js`. Export is v5 (see the C-scan
section); import still reads v3 and maps the old `wallThickness` onto `maxDepth`.
Pi-side architecture: bladerf_driver.py (HAL) → sfcw_engine.py (sweep logic) → sdr_server.py (WebSocket).

**SFCW params are pushed groundstation → Pi, never read back.** The engine carries its
own defaults, and `sfcw_set_params` used to be sent only from a panel field's `onChange`,
so a fresh page load left the Pi sweeping at its defaults while the panel displayed and
derived everything (step count, sweep time, max range) from different ones. `App.jsx`
`sendSfcwParams()` now pushes the full set on SDR connect and again before every
`sfcw_start` (all three start paths: both `App.jsx` handlers and the panel's own toggle).
The panel is the source of truth; keep new SFCW params in that payload or they will not
reach the Pi.
Next steps: SAR reconstruction integration.

## Sweep Timing (measured 2026-08-20)

**Measured sweep times** at 151 steps (20 MHz spacing, 2–5 GHz):
- Mean: 548 ms, effective rate 1.82 Hz.
- Per-step time: 3.63 ms (10 settle buffers × 4096 samples / 2 Msps = 20.5 ms settle
  + 1 capture buffer, but the real wall time per step is 3.63 ms because RX callbacks
  overlap — the settle wait is for *new* callbacks arriving, not elapsed time).

The per-step wait is `settle_count` RX buffer callbacks in `_sweep_core`, now a
user-controlled `SFCWEngine` param (default 10, exposed in the panel as "Settle",
same param family as `num_buffers`/"Buffers") rather than hardcoded. Sweep RX buffers
are 4096 samples at the 10 Msps set in `_configure_hardware`, i.e. 0.41 ms per buffer —
`BUFFER_SAMPLES` / `SAMPLE_RATE` in `SfcwPanel.jsx` mirror those two numbers and must
track the engine. `num_buffers` genuinely averages that many post-settle captures per
step now (see Quick-tune master table below) — the panel's per-step estimate is
`(settle_count + num_buffers) * 0.41ms`.

**Regression, 2026-08-20 to 2026-08-23 (fixed): do not drop `settle_count` below 10
without a real per-step validation.** An optimization pass (`407e205`, `510a9fe`) cut
the quick-tune `settle_count` from 10 to 7, gated behind an experimental
`sweep_mode='fast'` flag with an explicit "reduced if Test C proves it safe" caveat —
then the very next commit merged it in as the unconditional default and rewrote the
caveat into an unsubstantiated "validated over 50 sweeps" claim, with no test artifact
in the repo. Symptom: intermittent fully-garbled sweeps (good scans mostly,
occasionally one random-looking sweep, rarely two in a row) — one step retuning late
means its capture still holds the previous frequency's IQ, and since the range profile
is one IFFT across all steps, a single bad bin corrupts the whole sweep rather than
just that bin. Default reverted to 10. If it ever needs to drop again, validate with a
per-step check (flag/log which step index was corrupted), not just an aggregate
correlation over whole sweeps — an aggregate metric is exactly what let this ship
unnoticed. `benchmark_sweep.py` is a leftover from that pass and is currently broken
(references `_sweep_core_fast`/`sweep_mode`/`_qt_profiles_rx`, all since removed) —
needs a rewrite against the current `_sweep_core`/master-table API before it's useful
again.

**Regression, 2026-08-20 to 2026-08-23 (fixed): `num_buffers` default silently dropped
from 4 to 1, killing per-step noise averaging.** The `c33b0ce` "clean up" commit (same
day as the `settle_count` regression above) trimmed `sfcwParams`/`SFCWEngine` defaults
and dropped `numBuffers` from 4 to 1 — with no discussion, apparently just collateral
from tidying the defaults block. It went unnoticed at the time because the multi-buffer
averaging in `_sweep_core` was *itself* separately broken by the `407e205`/`510a9fe`
optimization pass: `num_buffers` only extended the settle wait but the code always
grabbed the single latest RX buffer regardless of its value, so for a few days the
setting had no effect at any value. `f98e208` (2026-08-23) fixed the averaging to
actually capture and mean `num_buffers` fresh buffers per step — but the default was
already 1, so the fix's benefit stayed invisible (1 buffer averaged with itself is a
no-op) until the default was corrected back. Symptom: sweep-to-sweep correlation stays
high (scene/multipath structure is unchanged) but per-sweep amplitude/phase noise is
visibly higher than before, burying fainter returns — because each step went from
averaging 4 captures (~6 dB of free SNR, `10*log10(4)`) down to 1. Confirmed live on
2026-08-23: 15-sweep static-scene comparison via the running `sdr_server`, mean
complex-domain deviation between sweeps was 0.0055 at `num_buffers=1` vs 0.0034 at
`num_buffers=4` (~39% reduction). Default restored to 4 in both `App.jsx` and
`SFCWEngine.__init__`. If `num_buffers` is ever dropped for speed again, check the
*current* live-sweep wobble against a static scene first, not just correlation —
correlation is insensitive to this because it doesn't wreck sweep structure, only
buries weak signal in noise.

## Quick-tune master table (2026-08-23)

Per-grid quick-tune profile caching is gone. `SFCWEngine._ensure_master_quick_tune_table()`
generates one fixed table spanning `QT_MASTER_START_FREQ`–`QT_MASTER_STOP_FREQ` (2–5 GHz)
at `QT_MASTER_STEP` (20 MHz) once per device connection — 151 profiles, paying the full
per-frequency VCO-cal cost (`bladerf_set_frequency` + `bladerf_get_quick_tune`) only that
once, ~6s total. `set_params()` snaps `start_freq`/`stop_freq` to the nearest 20 MHz and
clamps them into that range, and snaps `step_size` to a 20 MHz multiple (`_snap_freq`/
`_snap_step`), so every sweep's frequencies are guaranteed to land exactly on master grid
points. `_build_sweep_grid()` then just indexes into the cached table — no regeneration,
no device reset — so start/stop/step can change freely mid-session, live, with no
interruption.

This replaced the old scheme: profiles were cached per-`(start, stop, step)` combo, and
changing any of those three flipped `_freq_grid_dirty`, which forced a full
`driver.reset()` + reconfigure + restream on the next sweep (or mid-sweep, via
`_reconfigure_for_new_grid()`). That reset path was unreliable in practice — bladeRF
errors on the reopen — which is why it's gone rather than fixed. The master table only
needs invalidating (`SFCWEngine.invalidate_quick_tune_table()`) after an explicit
`device_reset` from the panel; `sdr_server.py`'s `device_reset` handler calls it.

**Hard ceiling: `MAX_QUICK_TUNE_PROFILES = 256`, do not exceed it.** The first version of
this table tried 1–6 GHz at 10 MHz spacing (501 profiles) and it was broken: verified
against libbladeRF's own source on the Pi
(`~/bladerf-src/host/libraries/libbladeRF/src/board/bladerf2/bladerf2.c:1419-1513`),
`bladerf_get_quick_tune()` is not a stateless read — every call allocates a slot and
*writes* a 16-byte fastlock profile into the AD9361 (only 8 slots per direction) plus a
copy into Nios RAM (`fastlocks_rx/tx[256]`); `rffe_profile = nios_profile % 8`, so the Nios
holds the authoritative 256 and re-uploads 16 bytes (18 SPI writes) whenever a slot collides.

**Corrected 2026-08-26 (traced against bladeRF @ 35174c30):** the cap is enforced
**host-side**, not on the device. `board_data->quick_tune_tx/rx_profile` is a `uint16_t` in
libbladeRF's own `bladerf2_board_data`, one counter per direction shared across both
sub-channels, checked against `NUM_BBP_FASTLOCK_PROFILES = 256`
(`fpga_common/include/bladerf2_common.h`, mirrored in the Nios' `devices.h`). There is no
device-side counter and no error returned from the device. It resets only on
`bladerf_open()` or `bladerf_load_fpga()` — `bladerf_device_reset()` against a held handle
does *not* reset it (our `driver.reset()` is safe only because it does a real close+reopen).

Past 256 calls it returns `BLADERF_ERR_UNEXPECTED` **before writing any field of the
caller's struct**, so the struct is left *untouched* — not zeroed, not garbage. An unchecked
return therefore re-submits the PREVIOUS call's profile, and the step captures at the
**previous frequency**. This corrects the earlier note here: the failure is a stale
frequency, not a random RF state — which matters because it is the *same observable* as a
too-short settle (see the `settle_count` regression above). The return-code check is the
only thing that distinguishes them. Symptom on stdout: a wall of
`[ERROR @ .../bladerf2.c:1452/1481] Reached maximum number of TX/RX quick tune profiles.`
repeated once per frequency past the cap, on every `start.py` run. `_ensure_master_quick_tune_table()`
now raises immediately if `len(freqs) > MAX_QUICK_TUNE_PROFILES` (compile-time check) or if
`bladerf_get_quick_tune()` ever returns nonzero (runtime check) — fail loud, never store an
unchecked profile. 2–5 GHz at 20 MHz is 151 profiles, comfortably under 256.

Consequence: the sweep range is hard-bounded to 2–5 GHz (panel Start/Stop min/max 2000/5000
MHz) — anything requested outside that gets clamped, and step size floors at 20 MHz. Widening
either means trading against the 256-profile ceiling (span_MHz / step_MHz + 1 ≤ 256) — there's
no way to have both a wide range and fine resolution simultaneously on this hardware without a
different strategy (e.g. a lazy per-frequency cache with a reset-triggered eviction, discussed
and deferred 2026-08-23 in favor of just picking a range/step that fits).

**Default step size is 60 MHz (51 steps, 2–5 GHz)** — `sfcwParams.stepSize` in
`App.jsx` and `SFCWEngine.step_size` both carry it, and the groundstation pushes its
value to the Pi on connect (see the param-push note above).

## Retune Path — How Tuning Actually Happens (traced 2026-08-26)

Full end-to-end teardown with source citations (host → USB → FX3 → command_uart → Nios II →
SPI → AD9361): https://claude.ai/code/artifact/3cec93b0-d371-4beb-b59a-b95ac8b96a26

**A quick tune carries no RF state.** `struct bladerf_quick_tune` on the micro is 5 bytes:
`nios_profile` (u16), `rffe_profile` (u8), `port`, `spdt` — indices, not settings. The
16-byte synthesizer snapshot (RFPLL int/frac, VCO varactor + cal offset, CP current, loop
filter, VCO divider, ALC word) lives in Nios RAM; the AD9361 holds only 8 at a time.

Facts that matter for sweep work:
- **The retune itself is ~1.8 µs.** `profile_activate()` = 3 SPI transactions:
  `adi_fastlock_recall()` (ONE write to AD9361 reg 0x25A RX / 0x29A TX), then a
  read-modify-write of reg 0x004 for port select, plus 2 FPGA PIO writes for the SPDT
  switches. The LO moves on the first write; the band switch trails ~1 µs. Everything else
  is transport: USB round trip ≥250 µs, command_uart 40 µs each way at 4 Mbaud (16-byte
  packets, retune2 magic `'U'` = 0x55; the magic filter is in VHDL, unknown magics are
  dropped in the fabric).
- `bladerf_schedule_retune()` **ignores its `frequency` argument entirely** — only
  `nios_profile` selects the frequency, so a wrong index is invisible at the call site.
- bladeRF does **not** call ADI's `ad9361_fastlock_recall()`; the Nios hand-rolls it as raw
  SPI. That bypasses the vendor ALC-collision workaround, and is why libbladeRF sets
  `rfic_reset_on_close` after any quick-tune use — the source of the ~6 s re-init on next open.
- The retune2 **response packet carries a `duration` field** (bytes 1–8): the Nios' own
  measurement of load+activate in sample ticks. libbladeRF unpacks it and discards it at
  `log_verbose`. Free on-device instrumentation we currently don't read.
- Nios `do_work()` — which services *scheduled* retunes — runs **only on main-loop
  iterations with no pending packet**. Control traffic during a sweep directly delays them.
- Retune queue is 16 deep per direction, **arrival-ordered, not timestamp-sorted**.

### Open questions — NOT verified on hardware

1. **RX gain table may be wrong for the entire sweep.** `ad9361_load_gt()` reloads the RX
   gain table only on a real `set_frequency`, at band edges **1.3 GHz and 4.0 GHz**; no
   fastlock path touches it. `_configure_channels_dual()` tunes to `driver.center_freq`, and
   `sfcw_engine.py` never sets that field — so it is still the **915 MHz** driver default,
   loading the 200–1300 MHz table for a 2–5 GHz sweep. `h_cal` cancels a constant gain error
   but not a wrong gain-vs-frequency shape or shifted clipping headroom. Test: set
   `driver.center_freq` into the sweep band before `_configure_channels_dual()` and compare
   per-step amplitudes.

2. **Scheduled retunes would silently fail today.** All four `sync_config()` calls in
   `bladerf_driver.py` use `Format.SC16_Q11`, not `SC16_Q11_META`. Without metadata the
   `meta_en` signal holds the timestamp counters in reset and the time_tamer FSM never
   leaves its reset branch, so `tamer_schedule()` is a no-op *with no error* — entries stick
   in `ENTRY_STATE_SCHEDULED` and after 16 the host gets `QUEUE_FULL` with no hint why.
   `fpga_builds/README.md` claims META is "already implemented" in the driver; that is
   **false for this branch**. Fix the format before attempting scheduled retunes.
   Related: the `meta_en` `RESET_LEVEL` FPGA modification that README documents is **not
   present** in `~/vikram/bladeRF` (all three synchronizers read `'0'`, tree clean), and
   would not work anyway — all three wire `reset => '0'`, so the reset branch is dead logic
   and `RESET_LEVEL` only sets a power-up value the Nios overwrites within 3 clocks via the
   `meta_sync` GPO.

**Pending optimisation:** `RETUNE_NOW` (`timestamp=0`, what we send today) runs
`profile_load()` + `profile_activate()` inline. The scheduled path instead runs
`profile_load_scheduled()`, which pre-loads up to 8 non-colliding profiles ahead of time
("to reduce retune times", per Nuand's comment). Our 60 MHz step selects master indices
0, 3, 6, 9… so `% 8` cycles all 8 RFFE slots — nearly every step pays a cold 18-SPI-write
load today. Gated on fixing the META format above.

## FPGA Guide — published reference doc (docs/fpga-guide/)

A five-chapter technical guide to the bladeRF hosted FPGA image, published as a Claude
Artifact and **rebuildable from this repo**:

  https://claude.ai/code/artifact/cd0df1ad-2556-428f-a75a-1b02b4236619

Chapters: 01 module inventory · 02 sample round trip (USB→RF→USB) · 03 the NIOS
(pins, functions, boot/shutdown) · 04 the TX FIFO · 05 the RX FIFO. Single page, sticky
chapter index, print styles for PDF export.

Sources live in `docs/fpga-guide/`: one `chN.frag.html` per chapter, `base-head.html`
for shared CSS, `index.frag.html` for front/back matter, and `build_guide.py`.

    cd docs/fpga-guide && python build_guide.py     # -> fpga-guide.out.html

Then publish with the Artifact tool passing `url=` the address above so the link stays
stable. **`docs/fpga-guide/README.md` is the maintenance guide** — read it before editing:
it covers adding a chapter (write a fragment, add one entry to the `CHAPTERS` table),
the available CSS classes, the inline-SVG rules (`currentColor`, self-closing shapes),
and the theme-token rule that keeps the page readable in dark mode.

The build fails loud on unbalanced tags, unclosed SVG shapes, or a nav/section count
mismatch. Do not publish if it aborts — a malformed page publishes silently.

Three older artifact URLs (`b4c106cb…`, `3c06de14…`, `79058fd7…`) were standalone
chapters before the merge; they now serve short "this moved" pointer pages and need no
maintenance.

Everything in the guide is traced from `bladeRF @ 35174c30` source. **Nothing in it is
measured on hardware** — several open questions are flagged as such in the text and
should stay flagged until someone actually measures them.

## Custom FPGA image — what is actually patched (corrected 2026-08-26)

`fpga_builds/hosted_timestamp_enabled.rbf` contains **one** HDL change, in `rx.vhd:140`:

```vhdl
if( meta_en = '1' or rx_enable = '1' ) then   -- stock: if( meta_en = '1' ) then
    timestamp_reset <= '0';
```

`timestamp_reset` becomes `rx_ts_reset` → the RX `time_tamer`'s `ts_reset`. Releasing it
whenever RX is enabled does **two** things:
1. the 64-bit sample counter free-runs, giving the Nios a time reference for autonomous
   frequency stepping; and
2. **the tamer's compare/interrupt FSM leaves reset.** This is the important one: with
   stock HDL and a non-META sample format, `tamer_schedule()` is a *silent no-op* — the
   FSM is pinned in its reset branch, queue entries stick in `ENTRY_STATE_SCHEDULED`
   forever, and after 16 the host gets `BLADERF_ERR_QUEUE_FULL` with no clue why. This
   patch is what makes `bladerf_schedule_retune()` work without `SC16_Q11_META`.

Note it does **not** enable metadata framing — the GPIF still sends no 16-byte headers, so
the host wire format is unchanged and still parses as plain SC16_Q11.

**KNOWN GAP: TX is not patched.** `tx.vhd:110` carries the byte-identical
`if( meta_en = '1' )` and was left alone, so the TX tamer is still held in reset.
`pkt_retune2` schedules RX retunes on `RX_TAMER_IRQ` and TX retunes on `TX_TAMER_IRQ`, and
`sfcw_engine.py` retunes **both** channels every step — so on this image a scheduled sweep
half-works: RX steps fire, TX steps never do, TX queue fills after 16. Closing it needs the
mirror edit `or tx_enable = '1'` at `tx.vhd:110` and an FPGA rebuild.

`rx_enable` was the right signal to use — it is the 3-FF synchronized copy of
`rx_enable_pclk` already in the `rx_clock` domain, so no new CDC hazard.

**`fpga_builds/README.md` described a different, non-functional change** (`RESET_LEVEL => '1'`
on the three `meta_en` synchronizers at `bladerf-hosted.vhd:802/813/824`). That edit is not
in the .rbf and would not work: all three wire `reset => '0'`, so the reset branch is dead
logic and `RESET_LEVEL` only sets a power-up value the Nios overwrites within 3 clocks. A
correction block has been added at the top of that README.

## bladeRF Source and Nios Simulators (local, undocumented until 2026-08-26)

- **bladeRF source checkout: `~/vikram/bladeRF`** (@ `35174c30`). Note
  `thirdparty/analogdevicesinc/no-OS` is an **unfetched submodule** — the AD9361 driver is
  not on disk; fetch pinned commit `0bba46e` if you need it. On the Pi the equivalent tree
  is `/home/sfr/bladerf-src`.
- **`pi/radar/nios_sim/sweep_sim`** — aarch64 ELF, built on the Pi at
  `/home/sfr/version0/pi/radar/nios_sim` from `sweep_sim.c` + the **real** `pkt_retune2.c`.
  ⚠️ **Only the binary is committed; `sweep_sim.c` exists nowhere in the repo or on this PC.**
  It entered via `f5c5e44 "removed camera"` (a catch-all commit). Retrieve the source from
  the Pi and commit it — right now this is an unbuildable, unmodifiable artifact.
- **`~/vikram/bladeRF/hdl/fpga/platforms/bladerf-micro/software/bladeRF_nios/sim/`** — a
  full PC simulator of the Nios firmware (real `main()` + all packet handlers as an x86-64
  binary, hardware replaced by register models, every access traced to console/CSV/VCD for
  GTKWave). Complete source present, **entirely untracked in git** — it lives only on this
  machine and will be lost on any re-clone of bladeRF. Its RFIC is a plain register file, so
  it models packet dispatch and register sequences, not RF behaviour.

## C-Scan Panel — 2D Raster (replaced the B-scan panel, 2026-08-20)

The B-scan panel is gone; `CscanPanel.jsx` + `CscanDisplay.jsx` + `lib/cscanGrid.js`
replace it. Panel id is `cscan` (was `bscan`). App-level state keeps its `bscan*` names
(`bscanData`, `bscanParams`, …) because the underlying record is still one B-scan trace
per position — only the panel and its geometry changed.

**Grid.** `bscanParams` is now `{ hCount, hStep, vCount, vStep, maxDepth, gateStart,
gateEnd, metric }`. `stepSize` / `numPositions` are gone; SAR and the 2D Map are 1D and
read `stepSize: hStep` (injected in `sarParams` / `mapStepSize`) with the position count
taken from the data length as before. The Scan Grid section sits between Session and
Capture so the rectangle is described before any sweep is tagged.

**Snake raster order** (`lib/cscanGrid.js` `cellForIndex`). Capture starts at the
bottom-left cell, sweeps the bottom row left→right, steps up one row, sweeps right→left,
steps up, and repeats. Verified: a 3×2 grid captures (0,0) (4,0) (8,0) (8,6) (4,6) (0,6)
for hStep 4 / vStep 6. Every position stores `grid_ix`, `grid_iy`, `x_cm`, `y_cm`,
resolved from the capture index at capture time in the `sfcw_result` handler (via
`bscanParamsRef`), so editing the grid afterwards never relabels existing cells. Lidar
standoff is captured per cell exactly as before.

**Display.** The viewport is Live Sweep (top) over C-Scan Grid (left) + the selected
row's B-scan (right). The grid is a plan view holding the physical aspect ratio, colour =
`gatedIntensity()` over the depth gate (peak / energy / mean), drawn live as cells fill.
Uncaptured cells are outlined and empty; a cell captured with no range bin inside the gate
is mid-grey, distinct from uncaptured. The next target pulses cyan, the snake path is
dashed over the captured cells, and clicking a cell picks the row shown in the B-scan pane
(that pane sorts the row by `grid_ix`, so a right→left row still reads left→right).

**Colour scaling** is one `{ dynamic, min, max }` object shared by both panes. Dynamic
tracks the captured cells; switching to manual seeds the sliders from the current dynamic
limits so colours do not jump, then the two dB sliders drive both images live. The sliders
are disabled and dimmed while dynamic is on, and the colour bar turns amber and reads
MANUAL when it is off.

**Export is v5** (`cscan_<ts>.json`): grid params plus per-position `grid_ix` / `grid_iy` /
`x_cm` / `y_cm`. Import accepts v3–v5; a v4 (or earlier) linear scan maps onto a one-row
grid (`hCount = numPositions`, `hStep = stepSize`, `vCount = 1`).

**Known limitation:** SAR and the 2D Map still treat the capture sequence as a single line.
With `vCount = 1` that is exactly the old behaviour; with more rows their input is a
zig-zag path and the reconstruction is not meaningful until they are made grid-aware.

## BG Model — Capture Protocol and Findings

**Capture protocol (as of 2026-08-18).** One capture = N sweeps at a **static** standoff
(N configurable in the BG Model panel, default 40, persisted to `localStorage.bgmodel_sweeps`).
Positions are hand-placed and deliberately **irregular**; irregular beats uniform, because
uniform undersampling folds alias energy coherently onto a single wrong spatial frequency
while irregular spacing scatters it. Target: ~30 positions over the widest span the bench
allows (150 mm+).

`bgCaptureStats.computeCaptureStats()` runs at capture completion and stores, per position:
coherent complex mean (`h_mean_real/imag` — this is the training target), per-frequency noise
variance, per-sweep and post-averaging SNR, sweep-pair correlation, standoff mean/std, and
`radarRangeM` (range of the dominant return from the coherent mean, sub-bin interpolated).
`radarRangeM` is **diagnostic only** — nothing consumes it. It exists so the dataset carries an
independent standoff estimate to check the lidar against.

Training now uses **one sample per position** (the coherent mean), not every raw sweep. Replicas
measure the same standoff repeatedly, so feeding them individually adds no information — MSE
regresses to this mean anyway, at N× the epochs.

**Spacing limits** (`spacingLimits()`). An echo with path multiplier α oscillates in standoff
with period `c / (2·f·(α−1))`; worst case is α=3 (triple bounce) at the top of the band. At
5 GHz that period is 15 mm, so:
- ≤ 5 mm gaps — well sampled
- 5–7.5 mm — coarse but unaliased
- Above 7.5 mm — α=3 folds onto a wrong spatial frequency and *corrupts* a fit rather than missing detail

**Span sets echo resolution:** `Δα = c / (2·f_c·span)`. At 3.5 GHz, 85 mm span → Δα = 0.50;
150 mm → 0.29. Widest possible span is the single biggest accuracy lever.

**Export format v2** (`bgmodel_<N>pos_<ts>.json`): hoists `common` (num_steps, step_size,
range_offset) out of the per-sweep repetition and stores per-capture `stats` + column arrays
(`standoffs`, `real`, `imag`). ~7 MB for 30 positions × 40 sweeps. Import accepts v1 and v2 and
backfills stats when absent.

**Analysis of the existing MLP** (1 → 64 → 64 → 302 ReLU, 23,918 params, `bgmodel.worker.js`):
- Output is effectively **rank ~5** — SVD over the input domain puts 96% of energy in 5 PCs,
  in near-equal quadrature pairs (the signature of complex sinusoids in `d`). 19,328 of its
  parameters describe a rank-5 map.
- Only 13/64 first-layer knots land inside the input domain; 32/64 L1 and 17/64 L2 units are
  dead across the whole domain.
- Per-frequency residual magnitude spans **20 dB**, so pooled scalar target normalization makes
  MSE a silently power-weighted loss that starves the weak bins.
- `finalLoss` is training MSE with no held-out split anywhere. Param:data ratio was 0.32:1.
- Inference is 19.3 µs (~52k/s), ~1700× headroom at 30 fps. Sweeps run at 3–6 Hz, so the model
  is nowhere near the bottleneck — **data, not compute, is the constraint.**

**Lidar precision is the hard ceiling.** Two-way phase is `4πfd/c`, so at 5 GHz **1 mm of
standoff error = 12° of phase error**. 20 dB of coherent suppression needs the standoff to
~0.5 mm; the TF-LC02 is a ±few-mm sensor. Comparing `radarRangeM` against `standoffMm` across
the new dataset is the cheap test of whether a radar-derived standoff beats the lidar.

**Result on the 30-position bench set (2026-08-18) — the MLP was replaced.**
Leave-one-position-out suppression, `10*log10(signal/error)` on each held-out position's
measured spectrum, 30 positions over 155.8 mm, median gap 5.5 mm, 15 sweeps each:

| estimator | LOO suppression |
|---|---|
| **Akima interpolation, unwind α=0.80** (shipped) | **20.2 dB** (median 20.3, worst 4.0) |
| cubic spline, α=0.80 | 20.3 dB — best mean, but −12.3 dB on a bad knot |
| physics model, K=5 echoes, free A(f) | 18.7 dB |
| linear interpolation | 12.4 dB |
| Fourier-feature MLP (tanh, k=8..64) | 11.9 dB |
| nearest position | 7.4 dB |
| physics model, K=3, Chebyshev A(f) | 6.8 dB |
| **old 1-64-64-302 MLP** | **4.9 dB** |
| global mean | 0.9 dB |

The captures are dense relative to how fast the background varies, so interpolation wins
outright and needs no parameters. `bgModelInterp.js` ships Akima: it gives up 0.6 dB of mean
for a 16 dB better worst case, because it does not propagate a bad capture into neighbouring
intervals. Inference is 3.1 µs (320k/s, ~10,000× headroom at 30 fps); model file ~360 KB.
Models are `type: 'interp'`; `bgModelInfer.js` keeps the MLP path for previously saved files.

**Things that turned out differently than expected:**
- **The old MLP was underfitting, not overfitting.** 2000 full-batch epochs reached only
  7.97 dB in-sample; 10k → 12.0 dB, 40k → 13.3 dB. Its `finalLoss` looked small only because
  targets were normalized by a single pooled scalar. Its loss curve was still falling 7.4%
  per 100 epochs at epoch 1999. Verified by scoring the saved `models/model 3.json` weights
  directly: 8.6 dB in-sample, matching the numpy re-implementation used for the LOO sweep.
- **The unwind is better with α ≈ 0.80 than α = 1.0** (20.5 dB vs 19.1 dB), a broad plateau
  over 0.70–0.85. Unwinding removes fast phase but injects the lidar's own error into the
  target; 0.8 is the trade-off point. The α matched filter puts the wall echo at 0.93–0.95,
  consistent with the lidar over-reporting standoff *change* by 5–20%. Worth a calibration
  check, but not required — the interpolator absorbs it.
- **The `radarRangeM` diagnostic is unusable**: correlation 0.36 with lidar standoff, 39.9 mm
  scatter after a linear fit. Dominant-peak picking hops between echoes in the near field.
  Radar-derived standoff is not a usable input; the near-field skepticism was correct.
- **Echo structure is dominated by two components**: α≈0.0 (static cable/coupling reflection,
  strongest) and α≈0.93 (wall face, −3.4 dB). Everything else is ≥13 dB down. But a smooth
  (Chebyshev) `A_k(f)` caps the physics model at ~7 dB; with `A_k(f)` free per frequency it
  reaches 18.7 dB. The unmodelled echoes get absorbed into `A_k(f)` as fast frequency
  structure, so `A_k(f)` is *not* smooth.
- **A physics + spline hybrid gives exactly no gain** over the spline alone (20.60 vs 20.59 dB).
- **Measurement noise is not the limit.** The 15-sweep coherent mean sits 47.1 dB below signal.
  Position density is the limit.

**Position density is the dominant lever** (cleaned 22-position set, subsampled):

| median gap | LOO suppression |
|---|---|
| 5.9 mm | 19.3 dB |
| 11.8 mm | 6.9 dB |
| 17.7 mm | −3.3 dB |

Roughly 12 dB lost per doubling of gap. Capture as densely as patience allows; this matters
far more than any modelling choice.

**Range gating cannot separate in-wall targets from the wall face at this bandwidth.** The
entire background sits within 2–6 cm of range, and 3 GHz of bandwidth gives ~50 mm range
resolution. The "gated" metric therefore tracks the full-band metric closely. Separating a
target from the face needs more bandwidth or aperture, not better background subtraction.
